HOW TO SET UP CONSTANTS:

1. Rename this file to Constants.swift
2. Register your application on Unsplash Developer portal (https://unsplash.com/developers)
3. Create a new application and obtain your API credentials
4. Replace placeholder values below with your actual Unsplash API credentials
5. Make sure Constants.swift is added to .gitignore to keep your keys private

Note: Constants.swift contains sensitive information and should never be committed to version control
